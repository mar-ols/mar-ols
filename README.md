<h1 align="center">Welcome to my bumble abode!</h1>

<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Marte</h1>
<h3 align="center">An eager frontend developer from Larvik, Norway</h3>

- 🌱 What I've learned so far is **Figma, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Wordpress and Git, but I am always looking to expand my knowledge and add new skills.**

- 👨‍💻 Some of my newest projects are available in my **<a href="https://mbo-portfolio.netlify.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">portfolio</a>. This will be updated as I work on new projects.**

- :hammer: As a worker **I'm focused, detail-oriented and hard-working. I'm an introvert but like to keep a light, happy tone with co-workers. And when starting new projects I don't like to procrastinate but rather dive in and get a lot done in the beginning stage to leave more room for fine improvement and fixing potential bugs later on.**

- ⚡ Fun fact **I went from being a fisherman to frontend dev. It was actually a more organic transition than it sounds like.**

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **any tricks or tips that might be useful for a new developer.**

- :heart: My interests besides coding is **The Sims 3, LOTR, traveling, binging movies and tv-shows, listening to music (Pink Floyd above all else), boardgames and pub quizzes.**

- 📫 You can reach me @ **marte.boe.olsen@gmail.com**
